# Dangerous intersections MVP

**Ignasi Sols**

The goal of this project is to identify the most dangerous intersections in the US that could be prioritized for conversion to roundabouts, based on current scientific evidence of a meta-analysis of 44 studies showing a 65% reduction in fatal accidents when junctions are converted to roundabouts. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28064101/). The aim is to reduce the number of accidents in the US, and their severity, through infrastructure changes. 

The workflow diagram is the following:
